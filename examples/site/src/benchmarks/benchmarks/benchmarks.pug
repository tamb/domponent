    h2 Benchmarks

    p These benchmarks measure the performance of 1000 components rerendering every 1 millisecond.
    p Each component constains a div and p elements as well as a text node.
    p You can click the links below and view the speed of the performance yourself.
    p As for actual measurements, here's what we test:
    ul
      li The components rerender for 1 minute
      li We run this for 10 separate iterations
      li We display the highest number of rerenders per minute on average
      li The lowest number of rerenders per minute on average
      li The average number of rerenders on average
      li The highest number of rerenders of all iterations
      li The lowest number of rerenders of all iterations
